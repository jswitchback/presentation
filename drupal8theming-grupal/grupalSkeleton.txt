Drupal 8 file structure

 - Core files are now in "core"
 - Contrib/Custom themes go in "themes" and "modules" folder
 - "Sites/all" & "default" still work but are best used on multisites (domain specific folders will get precedent)


Theme file changes
  THEMENAME.info.yml
  THEMENAME.libraries.yml
    -- themes are encouraged to create a library per component/topic/logical unit and hence are encouraged to not load all their CSS on all pages anymore, but to attach it when appropriate in a preprocess hook and/or only on the relevant pages via hook_page_attachments_alter()


  THEMENAME.theme (template.php)

New core base themes

  - Classy & Stable
  - Differences in class output


Misc Notes
  - No more first, last, odd, even classes. Left to CSS psuedo-selectors
  - Admin theme no longer compatible with ie8 and Android 2.3 (Background SVG)
  - Added HTML classes used solely for targeting with javascript. Prefixed with "js-". Do not style these classes.
