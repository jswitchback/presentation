DRUPAL 8 NOTES:


PHP --------------


Requires PHP 5.5.9 (or greater)
For better security support it is recommended to update to at least 5.5.21 or 5.6.5.


DRUSH --------------


** Drush must be version 8. Here's an article to run mutliple versions.
My install updates the default "drush" command for version 8 instead of using "drush8"
https://www.lullabot.com/articles/switching-drush-versions
Note: requires php5.4+ (Update to Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan or Google how to upgrade without a new OS)

Changes to Drush
drush cc all becomes drush cr (drush cache rebuild)

Short list of changes from 7 to 8 (drush cr & drush config ... Many more additions were previously added from version 6 to 7)

THEME --------------


General theming docs
https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8

Opposing base themes: Classy vs. Stable
Change the base theme in the info.yml file to inherit there template overrides
base theme: classy
base theme: stable
base theme: false #no base theme // If this line is missing it defaults to Stable

Classes are determined in the template itself. So no need to do an array_diff to remove core classes. Just override the core template.

Note: Bartik & Seven use Classy as their base theme

CSS naming follows BEM & SMACCS

JS ---------------


Added HTML classes used solely for targeting with javascript. Prefixed with "js-". Do not style these classes.

Attach js in theme library, hook, or in twig template
https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8/assets


SETTINGS.PHP -------------


Drupal 8 ships with a sites/example.settings.local.php file. It hard-codes the performance settings to off, so is extremely useful in a development environment. Simply copy it and rename it as sites/default/settings.local.php and uncomment the following lines in sites/default/settings.php:

<?php
# if (file_exists(__DIR__ . '/settings.local.php')) {
#   include __DIR__ . '/settings.local.php';
# }
?>


BROWSER SUPPORT ------------


IE 6/7/8 and Android 2.3 (Any browser without SVG capabilities is not supported)


CORE FILE STRUCTURE ----------

core:
This contains all of drupal core except for things that must be in the root, like index.php etc. Generally you shouldn't need to be adding/editing/removing anything in here.

themes:
This is where you put your site's themes (previously sites/all/themes).

modules:
This is where you put your site's modules (previously sites/all/modules).

profiles:
This is where you put installation profiles.

sites: This is used for running drupal multi-site setups and is used in the same way as in drupal 7. Modules & themes in sites/all/modules or sites/all/themes, will override ones in the base modules & themes directories. Modules in sites/SITENAME/modules and sites/SITENAME/themes will override others for the given site.



THEME NECESSITIES:

Tooltip
Modal (Is drupal modal enough?)
collapse on mobile with "read more"
Slideshow / carousel
mobile menu (accordion, collapse, modal)
responsive typography, double size on desktop?
